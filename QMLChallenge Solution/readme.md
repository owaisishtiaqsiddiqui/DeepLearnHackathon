# Summary
## Quantum Challenge: Feature Preparation & PCA Selection
Standardize Features:
- All 28 features are z-score standardized to mean 0, variance 1 (using StandardScaler).

- PCA Dimensionality Reduction:
  - The standardized features are projected onto a lower-dimensional space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
  - The number of components is set to n_qubits (e.g., 8), so the QNN input matches the quantum circuit width.

  **Example**
  `
    pca = PCA(n_components=n_qubits)
    X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)
  `
- Over 50% of the variance is typically retained in the first 8 principal components.

- Range Map for Quantum Encoding:
  Projected PCA features are mapped to the $[0, 2\pi]$ range for compatibility with quantum gates (MinMaxScaler).
- Train/Validation Split:
  PCA is applied on the entire standardized dataset before splitting, avoiding data leakage and ensuring consistent feature transformation on all splits.

- Result:
  The input to the QNN is a compact and information-rich $[N_\text{samples},n_{\text{qubits}}]$ matrix that maximizes usable signal per qubit.

This improves quantum training stability and performance, ensuring the model uses the most informative possible input while remaining compliant with the QML challengeâ€™s   qubit constraint!
